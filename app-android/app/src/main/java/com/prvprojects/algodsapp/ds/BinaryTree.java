public class BinaryTree {

    /*

    A binary tree is made of nodes, where each node contains a left pointer, a right pointer and
    a data element.

    The root node is the topmost node in the tree.

    The left and right pointers recursively point to smaller subtrees on either side.

    Empty tree is just a null Node.

    RECURSIVE DEFINITION: A binary tree is either empty (represented by a null pointer) or is made
    of a single node, where the left and right pointers of the node each point to a binary tree.

    Three types of binary trees:

    (i)     Full Binary Tree - A binary tree is full if every node has 0 or 2 children.

            Here, Number of Leaf Nodes, L = I, number of internal nodes

    (ii)    Complete Binary Tree - A binary tree is complete if all levels are completely filled,
            except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.

            e.g. Binary Heap

    (iii)   Perfect Binary Tree - A binary tree is perfect if all internal nodes have two children
            and all leaves are at same level.

            Here, a perfect binary tree of heaught h has r^h - 1 nodes.

    (iv)    Balancd Binary Tree - A binary tree is balanced if height of the tree is O(Log n) where
            n is number of nodes.

            e.g. AVL Trees, Red Black trees.

    (v)     Degenrate Tree - A tree where every internal node has one child. Perfomance wise same as
            linked lists. Also callsed pathological tree.
